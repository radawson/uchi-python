# Create a Python function that prints a greeting with a name as the parameter.
# Invoke the function with a name argument of your choosing

# def greeting(name):

## Section 3 - dictionaries:

# # Question 6: Create a dictionary named 'cellphone' with 2 key:value pairs that are the properties of your cellphone.
# # The keys should be: "color" and "number".
# # Fill out the values on your own:
# cellphone = {
#     "color": "silver",
#     "number":"867-5309"
# }

# # Question 7: Access a value from inside the dictionary (Try to print the value of the 'color' property).
# print(cellphone['color'])

## Section 4 - strings:

# Question 8: Create a variable and store a string with multiple words in it:

words = "The quick red fox jumps over the lazy brown dog"

print(words)
# Question 9: Utilize the method that capitalizes the first letter 
# of each word in your string - store this new string in a new variable:

more_words = words.title()

# Use a print statement to print the new string:
print(more_words)
print(more_words[::-1])
